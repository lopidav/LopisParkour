## A conversion mod that remakes ROUNDS into more traditional singleplayer platformer.

 - Select a level,
 - press something to spawn in,
 - run to the blue ball as fast as possible!

There are 20 maps by default. But i hope you'll make your own maps too and download other people's creations!

Hunt for the best times! Get bronze, silver, and gold medals! Unlock leaderboards and try going for the first place!
# In your mod manager please create a clean profile and install the mod there.
If you have mods (other then dependencies) active it might cause trouble.
Also leadearbord records scored while having extra mods turned on might be disqualified. Something like "performance improvements" is fine tho.
